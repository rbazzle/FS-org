# FamilySearch Strategic Objective Committee Charter

## 🎯 Purpose

FamilySearch Strategic Objective Committees (SOC) are structured to unify vision from senior staff with strategy, organizational planning and delivery through a cross-functional committee organized to, and responsible for the specific strategic outcome. Each committee is overseen by a director who is responsible for the committee's strategic outcome and is accountable for its success. This model provides the framework for unity, clarity, accountability, and agility—without prescription or dilution of strategic decision making.

## 🧭 Organizational Structure

### 🔹 Strategic Objective Outcomes as Anchors

FamilySearch has the following strategic objective outcome designations:

- Searchable Records
- Ordinance-Ready Names
- Submitters
- RootsTech
- Growth
- Platform

### 🔹 Committee Composition

Each SOC includes an assigned group of contributors. The Director assigns the Business Lead. Other senior leadership team members assign their respective staff participants to the committee. This ensures cross-discipline alignment throughout the organization. Each SOC is composed of:

- **Sponsor Director**
- **Strategic Objective Lead (SOC Lead)**
- **Strategic Objective Program Manager (PgM)**
- **Group Product Manager (GPM)**
- **Group Engineering Manager (GEM)**
- **Group Experience Manager (GUXM)**
- **Group Product Engagement Manager Lead (GPEM)**
- **Group Product Program Manager (GPgM)**
- **Business Intelligence Lead (BIL)**
- **Group QA Manager (GQAM)**
- **Other discipline contributors** as assigned (Homeland, QA, Data, Content, etc.)

This model is organized to foster clarity in roles and responsibilities, accountability for outcomes and delivery, and agility in adapting to discovery insights and shifting product and outcome priorities.
