SDLC - thinking about the process - Joe

Very much work-in-progress. NOT curated. NOT Approved. Just a way to keep track of work on
this - The Operating Model which will inform the SDLC document.

Object Taxonomy

🔷 1. Initiative – Strategic Business Goal
Definition: A high-level objective set by leadership, often tied to business performance (e.g.,
increase revenue, improve retention).
Purpose: Provides strategic direction and context for product teams.
Application: Teams align their work to initiatives to align their work, but they must translate
them into actionable outcomes.
Example: “Improve customer retention.”

🔷 2. Outcome – Measurable Customer Behavior
Definition: A specific, observable change in customer behavior that derives from an supports
the initiative.
Purpose: Shifts focus to impact (behavior) rather than output (features).
Types:
Business Outcomes: Lagging indicators (e.g., revenue) ) that teams can't directly control
Product Outcomes: Leading indicators (e.g., increased usage). Metrics teams can
influence directly.
Application: Teams negotiate outcomes with leadership and tracked via metrics.
Example: “Increase repeat purchases by 15%.”

🔷 3. Opportunity – Customer Need or Problem
Definition: A gap between customers expect and what they experience—pain points, desires,
or unmet needs.
Purpose: Guides discovery and ideation by surfacing real customer problems.
Application:
Discovered through interviews, usability tests, and feedback.
Organized in an Opportunity Solution Tree under the outcome.
Prioritized based on qualitative impact on the outcome.
Framing: Opportunities should be customer-centric and distinct, not vague sentiments or
disguised solutions.
Example: “Customers abandon carts due to unclear shipping costs.”

🔷 4. Solution – Hypothesis to Address an Opportunity
Definition: A proposed feature, change, or experiment designed to solve a specific
opportunity.
Purpose: Provides a tactical response to customer needs.
Application:
Teams generate multiple ideas.
Use assumption testing to validate before building.
Prioritize based on feasibility, desirability, and impact.
Example: “Add a shipping cost estimator to the cart page.”

🔶 5. WorkPlan
Workplan – Execution & Tracking Object
Definition: A time-boxed (≤90 days) plan that moves a validated solution through the phases
of the Operating Model (SDLC)
Idea Inception – Initial insight or trigger.
Draft Proposal – Early framing of the solution and assumptions.
Investigate – Discovery, validation, and assumption testing.
Build – Engineering implementation.
Release & Measure – Deployment to users. – Evaluate impact against the outcome.
Purpose: Operationalizes solutions and ensures delivery is time-bound and iterative.
Application: Anchored to a solution, usually scoped to a single team, and used to track
progress and learning.

sdlc-cmte: “We might use all of it, or just part of it, but my understanding is that it is still being
reviewed and discussed. Which is why I mentioned during our last SDLC Document
Committee meeting that aligning with the Ferenc diagram was a much lower priority right now,
and not something we would be working on during Q3.”
see below
What is the glossary: objects (on the conveyor belt, initiatives, deliverables
proposals/requests…), touchpoints/gates, entities (teams groups… that interact) what they do to
the objects.

Can it be simpler - like the previous SDLC and how to modify it.

Blueprint of the Process? - August 22, 2025
Build a Blueprint of the process, then the SDLC can document it, tools can implement the
process..
I would like to see a blueprint of what the full process is, then get that accepted and then
document and implement it. - just like our initiative - eat our own dog food? For instance :
Where is "Done"
Where is Production release (THeres a main heading called Release & Measure - but I see
no Release - and how is % rollout handled
Where do we capture and track measure after Release - copilot, jira...? For how long. i.e. in
FSPL once its Done there is an urgency to get it out of theway and not look at outcome
I think the Proposal to Investigate is ambiguous and doesnt seem to have the rigor to
adequately access ROI... for instance this has many aspect that should be part of the rigor:
Cookbook of Product Architecture
In summary: I feel I’m lacking seeing a “blueprint” - something that defines the steps, stages,
objects, etc. of the SDLC process. Running some sample efforts will help us define the blueprint:

Define the process - “blueprint" for the sake of this discussion. With the process defined then
the org can:
Document the process. Maybe this is the SDLC document
Implement the tools that support the process
a. in Pilot
b. in Jira
c. ...
Possibly consider organization changes that support the execution of the process
One way to arrive at the blueprint is to take one or two efforts that are in-flight today and see
what is working and what is lacking. This is not a fault of the team, but rather the ambiguity of
the current process and of the culture of the organization. For starters I suggest running two
sample efforts (initiatives) through this exercise:
Sample 1: Golden tree hints
Sample 2: ?
Where is the canonical form of the process? We have discussed that the Ferenc diagram, Pilot
execution, Jira structure are not in sync. Once we have that blueprint we can carve out work
to document and implement and refine.
a. The “blueprint” should be descriptive and non-ambiguous.
i. It defines the phases, steps, stages, roles, objects (initiative, workplace), dashboards,
integration touchpoints, etc.
ii. Define the effort’s characteristics (i.e Outcome, hypothesis, …) that need to be
considered as part of the approval process
iii. Define the efforts ROI/Outcome and how that/when that is executed
b. It is a living definition that represents the conceptual plan and as-built state. Like a building
blueprint.
c. It should answer the questions of how to build Pilot, what Pilot needs to track and show, i.e.
dashboards...
d. “ “ “ how to build Jira
The SDLC document documents this process. It could be the blueprint of the process. It
might get too long but the detail of this blueprint should be captured, somewhere.
Appendixes might be a way to organize the document.
Pilot and Jira implementation are the architecture and coding of the blueprint. We realize this
is resource intensive in terms of implementation of the tool, but even more costly in terms of
team and human execution in working with the tool.

a. Changing the model is expensive so a well-designed process upfront will pay off in the long

run,

So let's take a sample and run it through today's execution. This is a reflection of process
ambiguities and culture impact.
Is it well designed, and properly defined in terms of Discovery, and approval? What are the
Outcomes...
Is it in Build and CD? What does it look like in the dashboards, i.e. in Pilot, in Jira, resource
tracking, roll-out.
Is it Done? When is it Done? Is it in Release?
Where is the Outcome being tracked, especially after Release? How do we analyze and
validate the Outcome?
How do we deal with unhappy path - the Outcome is not matching ROI expectations - can we
enhance, pivot, kill an effort? What is the cost in User fatigue?...
Are we losing user experience defects by marking Jiras as WAD to get them out of sight?
Are we missing the outcome aspects by quickly removing that work, that line, from the
dashboard?
...
Is this rough idea a worthwhile approach, and/or how should it be refined?

1. What is the process? It would be nice to have a blueprint of the approved process. This can
adapt over time
2. What does the process cover?
3. Who does the process apply to:
a. FS Engineering
b. Homelands?
c. Councils?
d. Committees?
e. Anything the user sees under the familysearch.org domain?
4. Once we have the process defined and approved decide how to implement and make it
visible, actionable and we are held responsible to it
a. just like our initiative - eat our own dog food?
b. Pilot?
c. Jira?
d. ... ?
5. What is the purpose of the SDLC? to document the process? Stick/Carrot?
6. Things missing?
a. Where is "Done"
b. Where is Production release (THeres a main heading called Release & Measure - but I see
no Release - and how is % rollout handled
c. Where do we capture and track measure after Release - copilot, jira...? For how long. i.e. in
FSPL once its Done there is an urgency to get it out of theway and not look at outcome
d. I think the Proposal to Investigate is ambiiguous and doesnt seem to have the rigor to
adequately access ROI... for instance this has many aspect that should be part of the rigor:

SDLC Software "Development" Life Cycle maybe misnamed?
This effort and what the org wants if more than Development. It wants Outcome, not just
Output. Development implies output, whereas Outcome is more long-lived, beyond Shipping.
I wonder if the SDLC title itself conveys more about creation of the thing, rather than the
outcome, especially in experiences that we are investigating, build, testing, releasing,
measuring and then deciding about success/failure/iterating?

Should the SDLC be renamed FSSLC - FamilySearch Software Life Cycle or something more
broad - across the full life-time of software we build, or even Experiences we create?- SELC
Some whiteboard thinking:

Ferenc diagrams
what latitude do we have to enhance/question it? Or is it already approved as the blueprint of
the process? https://www.figma.com/design/eLKoxoqmhCOCAd8pzDpCpU/Pilot-v.2f?nodeid=0-1&p=f&t=oFGb7PgWt0nwE1u1-0.

Update: October 2024.
A new version has been provided: 2.2. The diagrams have been changed a bit, but the review I
provided did not appear to have any affect. I have modified and done strikeout in the original
review below.

SDLC Version 2… 024.pdf
14 Oct 2024, 06:53 PM

SDLC 2.1. Review - 2024 Proposal=
Management asked for comments on a new FamilySearch Software Development Lifecycle to
replace the current one. This is an early review of pages 1-21.
Thanks for requesting comments on the SDLC that is being worked on. I don’t know who
authored this nor who the audience is so please read my narrative as an opinion, that may be
uninformed.
No particular order but reading from page 1.
1. Who is the reader? 40 37 pages is really thick for a in-flight guide. Personally 10-12 pages

would be my ability to consume. If its supposed to be a definitive detailed reference then it
could be longer.
2. Is there supposed to be actionable content? Something like a cookbook?
3. There’s a couple ways to approach a big Process thing like this.
a. One is to do a new greenfield ground-up approach.
b. Another way is to look at what we have, and what is and what is not working well, and
provide a “update” or bigger yet “refactoring” of what we have today. I look at the diagram,
and that booklet and say what worked, and what didn’t. Did people even use it?
4. Most of the document seemed like an aggregation of multiple Sources, with collisions of
concept and word choices. So it comes across as redundancy, and multiple snippets without
coherency.
a. One way to tackle this problem is to create a Glossary, and in that define each term. Doing
this requires
i. consolidation of mental models, not simply aggregation of independent pieces.
ii. Coherency across the terms
iii. Disambiguation between the terms, so the reader can see that this means this, vs. that
means something different.
b. Here are examples of terms that are related, but maybe should be or not, and some are
undefined
i. User, Patron, Customer,
ii. Outcome, Result, Deliverable, Product, Project, Production
iii. Discovery, investigation, Design, Ideation
iv. Growth Loop
v. x- Journey, Story,
c. Organization, Roles seem to be unorganized.

i. Portfolio Steering Committee is talked about last, but hierarchically should be first?
ii. Missing Role: Engineer!
iii. Missing aspects

1. Data/Tree quality and integrity
2. Information architecture (User domain model coherency, i.e. SCOE)

iv. I feel like we are adopting some of the Torres book. The book is good, but it falls far short

on aspects:
1. “Outcome” is ambiguous. It does attempt to define it but is not very actionable
because of lack of discernment and disambiguation.
2. User Interview is a good 101 approach for a new org. For a mature org like us there are
huge potential of graduating to better User Inquiry and Design tools like Contextual
Design. Her anti-patterns illustrate, she does not truly understand user inquiry tools
and the intricacies of human (user test) behaviors.
3. Her approach to Design is hand-waving – there is no actionable approach and leaves
the reader floundering (that’s why they want you to pay for their consulting services?)
v. User testing (more Torres book thinking)
1. Sure we can do testing along the whole journey. But different phases (see below) of

the journey have different user interaction/testing actions.
2. Dual track is good but it misses the actionable approach.
3. User testing anti-pattern here is to “validate”. No, the user testing should seek to
“break” and invalidate your assumptions.
4. My belief is most creators are unable to separate themselves from their baby, and
confirmation bias will lead to false results and solutions. Even “outcome” is biased as
well. A neutral party should be part of any testing and metric analysis.
vi. The diagrams
1. These are a cartoon drawing of the typical agile/sprint iteration process along a
timeline. Redone, as "Two tracks" but the different size circles in the top row are
confusing. Also the fidelity of information has been removed making the diagram more
ambiguous.
2. What is the full life journey of the project…? The transition from design, prototype,

implementation, production, maintenance is lacking.
3. They really do not illustrate how design fits into the full life journey of a project/effort/…
4. Where is the post-production measure and ROI analysis stage?

a. When can we say we succeeded at time x, or failed? What are those metrics?
5. Our previous diagram was more descriptive. Should that be the detail with a wider loop

around it? (Back to the earlier approach question of greenfield, vs. modify)
5. Post-review Additional items
a. Production Readiness seems like it will be out of date form the confluence page criteria:
Production Readiness Criteria
b. This is ambiguous: "We design beyond typical spoken and written language and tap into
the immense power of spatial thinking. We encourage externalized thinking, and mapping
what we know." Perhaps it should revert to the original in Torres' Continuous Discovery
Habits: "Visualizing what we know and what we think unlocks our immense capacity for
spatial reasoning." And really they are referring to diagrams like Journey Maps.
c. I think the new Product/Feature Discovery 2-diamond diagram is confusing. Video 1 and
Video 2 are new, undefined concepts.If we want to dive into detail of Video1 and Video2
there is a whole new document, and I would suggest we encompass Contextual Design
(the origin of Video 1 and Video 2) and how this should integrate with Continuous Discovery
that we are eluding to in the SDLC.
d. think if a new hire could understand this document, or launch to more definition?
e. Need more coherency and removal of redundancy between Sell-Off, Definition of Done,
Product Readiness.
